Project Overview
Crypto-Portfolio App is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to manage their cryptocurrency portfolio. Users can add tokens to their watch list, view current and historical balances, check token allowances, and transfer tokens to other addresses. The application connects to the Ethereum blockchain via MetaMask or by allowing users to input a wallet address directly.

Features
Wallet Connection: Connect to your wallet using MetaMask or input a wallet address manually.
                    Token Watch List: Add tokens to your watch list and monitor their balances in real-time.
Historical Balance: View the historical balance of each token over a selected date range.
Token Allowance: Check the allowance of tokens for different smart contracts.
Token Transfer: Transfer tokens to other addresses directly from the application.
Data Visualization: Display token balances, historical data, and allowances using charts and graphs for better visualization.
Technical Stack
Frontend: React.js
Blockchain Interaction: Ethers.js
Visualization: Chart.js, React-Chart.js, and React DatePicker
Getting Started
Prerequisites
